      <p>
        The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of someone's weight in relation
        to their height. It is often used to check whether they have a healthy
        weight. A BMI greater than 25 could signal that one is overweight and a
        BMI greater than 30 could signal obesity. Some people use this as an
        indicator to make dietary adjustments towards healthier living.
